Lucide React


To Do:
Make all Cards Clickable:
    Portfolio is important. We want a way to get feedback on the site.
    Signal Surge Card should just be an About page with a link to request services
    Revenue Prediction can be an About Page with a link to the GitHub Repo
    Targeting Card can be an About Page with no external links
    Freelance Music can be an About Page with the Github link and links to Waylon, Jacob and my LinkedIns.

Host the site
    Database hosting?
    Actual url hosting?

Sort by Functionality on the Home page?
