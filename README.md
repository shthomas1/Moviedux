Thank you for looking into my page. I want to make this useable by others at some point, 
so I will eventually change the inputs from all of the Component pages to API calls so that anyone can put their own information in.

Right now, all you would need to do to change the majority of information is change the JSON files: cardinfo and projects. These hold most of the information on the site.
You would also need to go change the links in the javascript as well as names, but I imagine if you made it to the github, you knew that.
